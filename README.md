A heap of old C++ files I created over the years.
---------------------------------------------------------


This repo is a heap of old programs made when I was learning my way around C++. They'd be sitting on my hard drive doing nothing otherwise. A short description of each file follows:

MyDate - Simply outputs to the command line the day the program was made.

ScoreAvg - Takes command line input of three numbers and finds the average of them.

GameList - Uses linked lists to keep a tally of game titles to a digital 'shelf' using strings via command line. Needs to be updated, as strings containing spaces throw the program for a loop.

guess_my_number - Random number between 1 and 100 generated, takes guesses from user via command line.

guess_your_number 2 - Allows user to input a number between 1 and 100, guesses input number.

myMod - Uses the modulus operator for 4 on every number between 1 and 20.

stairs - Recursively generates an ascii staircase via command line

tester - A word jumble game via command line, complete with hints.
